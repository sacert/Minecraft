# Minecraft

Project currently on hold as I review for interviews.

Large part of the game is already completed. Fully functional and playable.

TO DO:

Implement threading - only need to do this for the CPU side, OpenGL handles the GPU side.
Add a database to store chunk data = sqlite should be fine.
